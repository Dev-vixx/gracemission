GRACE MISSION INTERNATIONAL

WE ARE DISCIPLINED, SIMPLE, CREATIVE, RELEVANT, ORGANIZED, AUTHENTIC, CHRIST CENTERED. 




- Our Vision
Create and environment where people will be exposed to the influence of the Holy Spirit and God's word. 


Bind the broken hearted, proclaim freedom for the captives, release from darkness for the prisoners and be used to bestow a crown of beauty instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, a farment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. 


Promote and reinforce the Prophetic in the body of Christ

Raise a vibrant people surrendered unto God. Gull of dignity and overflowing with His supernatural grace and favour.
